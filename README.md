This project demonstrates hands-on experience with data annotation for OCR and NLP tasks using Label Studio.  
The goal was to build a Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset for invoices by labeling key fields such as invoice number, date, vendor, and total amount.

üéØ Project Overview  
- Set up a project in Label Studio named Invoice Annotation  
- Imported sample invoices in JSON format
Created custom labels:
Invoice_Number,
Date,
Vendor_Name,
Total_Amount
- Annotated invoices by highlighting fields and assigning labels
- Exported structured annotations in CSV/JSON format for downstream ML use

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies  
- Label Studio (open-source annotation tool)
- JSON/CSV exports for ML integration
- GitHub for project versioning & portfolio sharing

üí° Why This Matters

This project shows how structured annotation can:  
- Train OCR + NLP pipelines for automatic invoice parsing
- Improve accuracy of document processing systems
- Provide clean training data for machine learning models
